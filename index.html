          <p>An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a powered, fixed-wing
            aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller or rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers annually on airliners[1] and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometers[2] of cargo annually, which is less than 1% of the world's cargo movement.[3] Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on
            board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled such as drones.</p>

            <p>The Wright brothers invented and flew the first airplane in 1903, recognized as "the first sustained and
            controlled heavier-than-air powered flight".[4] They built on the works of George Cayley dating from 1799,
            when he set forth the concept of the modern airplane (and later built and flew models and successful
            passenger-carrying gliders).[5] Between 1867 and 1896, the German pioneer of human aviation
            Otto Lilienthal also studied heavier-than-air flight. Following its limited use in World War I,
            aircraft technology continued to develop. Airplanes had a presence in all the major battles of
            World War II. The first jet aircraft was the German Heinkel He 178 in 1939. The first jet airliner, the de Havilland
            Comet, was introduced in 1952. The Boeing 707, the first widely successful commercial jet, was in commercial
            ervice for more than 50 years, from 1958 to at least 2013.</p>

            <h4 id="antecedents">Antecedents</h4>
            <p>Many stories from antiquity involve flight, such as the Greek legend of Icarus and Daedalus,
            and the Vimana in ancient Indian epics. Around 400 BC in Greece, Archytas was reputed to have
            designed and built the first artificial, self-propelled flying device, a bird-shaped model propelled
            by a jet of what was probably steam, said to have flown some 200 m (660 ft).[11][12] This machine
            may have been suspended for its flight.[13][14]</p>
            <p>Some of the earliest recorded attempts with gliders were those by the 9th-century Andalusian and
            Arabic-language poet Abbas ibn Firnas and the 11th-century English monk Eilmer of Malmesbury; both
            experiments injured their pilots.[15] Leonardo da Vinci researched the wing design of birds and designed a
            man-powered aircraft in his Codex on the Flight of Birds (1502).</p>
            <p>In 1799, George Cayley set forth the concept of the modern airplane as a fixed-wing flying machine
            with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.[16][17] Cayley was building and flying
            models of fixed-wing aircraft as early as 1803, and he built a successful passenger-carrying glider in 1853.[5]
            In 1856, Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Bris made the first powered flight, by having his glider
            "L'Albatros artificiel" pulled by a horse on a beach.[18] Then the Russian Alexander F. Mozhaisky also
            made some innovative designs. In 1883, the American John J. Montgomery made a controlled flight in a
            glider.[19] Other aviators who made similar flights at that time were Otto Lilienthal, Percy Pilcher,
            and Octave Chanute.</p>
            <p>Sir Hiram Maxim built a craft that weighed 3.5 tons, with a 110-foot (34 m) wingspan that was powered by
            two 360-horsepower (270 kW) steam engines driving two propellers. In 1894, his machine was tested with
            overhead rails to prevent it from rising. The test showed that it had enough lift to take off.
            The craft was uncontrollable, which Maxim, it is presumed, realized, because he subsequently abandoned work on it.[20]</p>
            <p>In the 1890s, Lawrence Hargrave conducted research on wing structures and developed a box kite that lifted the
            weight of a man. His box kite designs were widely adopted. Although he also developed a type of rotary aircraft
            engine, he did not create and fly a powered fixed-wing aircraft.[21]</p>
            <p>Between 1867 and 1896, the German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal developed heavier-than-air
            flight. He was the first person to make well-documented, repeated, successful gliding flights.</p>
            <h4 id="early">Early powered flights</h4>
            <p>Patent drawings of Clement Ader's Éole.The Frenchman Clement Ader constructed his first of three flying
            machines in 1886, the Éole. It was a bat-like design run by a lightweight steam engine of his own invention,
            with four cylinders developing 20 horsepower (15 kW), driving a four-blade propeller. The engine weighed
            no more than 4 kilograms per kilowatt (6.6 lb/hp). The wings had a span of 14 m (46 ft). All-up weight
            was 300 kilograms (660 lb). On 9 October 1890, Ader attempted to fly the Éole. Aviation historians give
            credit to this effort as a powered take-off and uncontrolled hop of approximately 50 m (160 ft) at a
            height of approximately 200 mm (7.9 in).[22][23] Ader's two subsequent machines were not documented
            to have achieved flight.[24]</p>
            <p>The American Wright brothers flights in 1903 are recognized by the Fédération Aéronautique
            Internationale (FAI), the standard setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics, as "the first
            sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight".[4] By 1905, the Wright Flyer III was
            capable of fully controllable, stable flight for substantial periods. The Wright brothers credited Otto
            Lilienthal as a major inspiration for their decision to pursue manned flight.</p>
            <h4 id="jet">Development of jet aircraft</h4>
            <p>The first practical jet aircraft was the German Heinkel He 178, which was tested in 1939. In 1943, the Messerschmitt
            Me 262, the first operational jet fighter aircraft, went into service in the German Luftwaffe. In October 1947, the
            Bell X-1 was the first aircraft to exceed the speed of sound.[31]</p>
            <p>The first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet, was introduced in 1952. The Boeing 707, the first widely successful
            commercial jet, was in commercial service for more than 50 years, from 1958 to 2010. The Boeing 747
            was the world's biggest passenger aircraft from 1970 until it was surpassed by the Airbus A380 in 2005.</p>
