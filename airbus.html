          <h3>Basic Information</h3>
          <p>Airbus SE (/ˈɛərbʌs/; French: [ɛʁbys] (About this soundlisten); German: [ˈɛːɐ̯bʊs] (About this soundlisten);
            Spanish: [ˈejɾbus]) is a European multinational aerospace corporation. As of 2019, Airbus is the world's
            largest airliner manufacturer and took the most airliner orders.[7] Airbus is registered in the
            Netherlands; its shares are traded in France, Germany and Spain. It designs, manufactures and sells
            civil and military aerospace products worldwide and manufactures aircraft in the European Union and
            various other countries. The company has three divisions: Commercial Aircraft, Defence and Space, and
            Helicopters, the third being the largest in its industry in terms of revenues and turbine helicopter
            deliveries.[8]</p>
          <p>The company's main civil aeroplane business is based in Blagnac, France, a suburb of Toulouse, with production
            and manufacturing facilities mostly in the European Union (France, Germany, Spain) but also in China,
            the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. Final assembly production is based in Toulouse,
            France; Hamburg, Germany; Seville, Spain; Tianjin, China; Mobile, United States; and Montreal, Canada.[9]
            The company produces and markets the first commercially viable digital fly-by-wire airliner,
            the Airbus A320,[10][11] and the world's largest passenger airliner, the A380. The 12,000th aircraft, an A220,
            was delivered to Delta Air Lines on 20 May 2019.[12] By October 2016, the global Airbus fleet have
            performed more than 110 million flights, totalling over 215 billion kilometres and carrying 12 billion
            passengers.[13]</p>

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>The current company is the product of consolidation in the European aerospace
            industry tracing back to the formation of the Airbus Industrie GIE consortium in 1970.
            In 2000, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) NV was established.
            In addition to other subsidiaries pertaining to security and space activities, EADS owned 100% of the
            pre-existing Eurocopter SA, established in 1992, as well as 80% of Airbus Industrie GIE. In 2001, Airbus
            Industrie GIE was reorganised as Airbus SAS, a simplified joint-stock company. In 2006, EADS acquired
            BAE Systems's remaining 20% of Airbus.[15] EADS NV was renamed Airbus Group NV and SE in 2014, and 2015,
            respectively.[16][17][18] Due to the dominance of the Airbus SAS division within Airbus Group SE,
            these parent and subsidiary companies were merged in January 2017, keeping the name of the parent company.
            The company was given its present name in April 2017.[19]</p>
