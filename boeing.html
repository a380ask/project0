          <h3>Basic Information</h3>
          <p>The Boeing Company (/ˈboʊɪŋ/) is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and missiles worldwide. The company also provides leasing and product support services. Boeing is among the largest global aerospace manufacturers; it is the second-largest defense contractor in the world based on 2018 revenue,[6] and is the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value.[7] Boeing stock is included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Boeing is incorporated in Delaware.[8]</p>
          <p>Boeing was founded by William Boeing in Seattle, Washington on July 15, 1916.[9] The present corporation is the result of the merger of Boeing with McDonnell Douglas on August 1, 1997. Then chairman and CEO of Boeing, Philip M. Condit, assumed those roles in the combined company, while Harry Stonecipher, former CEO of McDonnell Douglas, became president and COO.[9]</p>
          <p>The Boeing Company has its corporate headquarters in Chicago, Illinois.[10] Boeing is organized into five primary divisions: Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA); Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS); Engineering, Operations & Technology; Boeing Capital; and Boeing Shared Services Group. In 2017, Boeing recorded US$93.3 billion in sales, ranked 24th on the Fortune magazine "Fortune 500" list (2018),[11] ranked 64th on the "Fortune Global 500" list (2018),[12] and ranked 19th on the "World's Most Admired Companies" list (2018).[13] In 2019, Boeing's global reputation, commercial business, and financial rating suffered after the 737 MAX was grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes in late 2018 and early 2019.</p>

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>The Boeing Company was started in 1916, when American lumber industrialist William E. Boeing founded Aero Products Company in Seattle, Washington. Shortly before doing so, he and Conrad Westervelt created the "B&W" seaplane.[14][15] In 1917, the organization was renamed Boeing Airplane Company, with William Boeing forming Boeing Airplane & Transport Corporation in 1928.[14] In 1929, the company was renamed United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, followed by the acquisition of several aircraft makers such as Avion, Chance Vought, Sikorsky Aviation, Stearman Aircraft, Pratt & Whitney, and Hamilton Metalplane.[2]</p>
          <p>In 1931, the group merged its four smaller airlines into United Airlines. In 1934, the manufacture of aircraft was required to be separate from air transportation.[16] Therefore, Boeing Airplane Company became one of three organizations to arise from dissolution of United Aircraft and Transport; the other two groups were United Aircraft (later United Technologies) and United Airlines.[2][16]</p>
          <p>In 1960, the company bought Vertol Corporation, which at the time, was the biggest independent fabricator of helicopters.[17] During the 1960s and 1970s, the company diversified into industries such as outer space travel, marine craft, agriculture, energy production and transit systems.[2]</p>
          <p>In 1995, Boeing partnered with Russian, Ukrainian and Anglo-Norwegian organizations to create Sea Launch, a company providing commercial launch services sending satellites to geostationary orbit from floating platforms.[18] In 2000, Boeing acquired the satellite segment of Hughes Electronics.[2][19]</p>
          <p>Corporate headquarters were moved from Seattle to Chicago in 2001.[20]</p>
          <p>After two fatal crashes of the Boeing 737 MAX narrow-body passenger airplanes in 2018 and 2019, aviation regulators and airlines around the world grounded all 737 MAX airliners.[21] A total of 387 aircraft were grounded.[22] Boeing's reputation, business, and financial rating has suffered after these groundings, questioning Boeing's strategy, governance, and focus on profits and cost efficiency.[23][24][25] The Wall Street Journal reported on May 5, 2019 that Boeing had known of the issue with the system for "about a year" before the crash in Indonesia.[26] In December 2019, Boeing announced it will suspend 737 MAX production from January 2020.[27] Soon after, on December 23, then CEO Dennis Muilenburg resigned and was replaced by David Calhoun.[28]</p>
